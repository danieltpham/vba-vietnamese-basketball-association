## Conclusions
Analysis on the current Employment & Population datasets of City of Melbourne reveals that there is little evidence for a predisposition for industrial specialisation in Melbourne CBD. Most employments and industries are highly concentrated in the CBD area, turning the most important area of the dataset to an outlier which challenges the interpretation. However, the analysis reveals a potential for Dockland to become the next Central Business District of Melbourne; and a strong focus on Business & Professional Services for City of Melbourne.
